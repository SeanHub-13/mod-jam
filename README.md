## Description

Small 6 x 6 grid, flashes a pattern made on the grid to the player, then asks them to recreate it as best as they can draw it from memory.
Compares how well they did based on what grid tiles they drew on, then gives a score.
If the player gets a score above a certain amount each round, they continue, if not, triggers game over and displays their score.
When the player wins a round, decreases drawing time by 2 down to a minimum of 4.
If the player wins 3 rounds (up to 12) increases grid columns and rows by 2.

I decided not to make a modification of the game FROGFROGFROG because I knew that would be relatively easy for me to make and wanted to make something new instead.
Also because I might wanna implement a similar system into another project.
